# Requirements Document: AI-Controlled Panel with Tabs and Zones

## Overview

The objective of this change is to enhance the interactive chat UI by introducing a side panel that supports multiple tabs, each containing vertically stacked "zones" (rows). Each zone can display interactive components, and the AI agent can dynamically control the contents, focus, and configuration of the panel, tabs, zones, and components.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Panel Structure

- The UI shall include a side panel adjacent to the main chat interface.
- The panel shall support multiple tabs.
- Each tab shall contain one or more "zones", which are vertically stacked rows.
- Each zone shall render a list of interactive components (e.g., tables, charts, forms).

### 2. AI Control Capabilities

The AI agent must be able to:

- Add, remove, rename, and reorder tabs.
- Set which tab is currently in focus (active).
- Add, remove, and reorder zones within a tab.
- Add, remove, update, and reorder components within a zone.
- Move components between zones and between tabs.
- Replace the entire panel state atomically (for resets or large updates).

### 3. Data Model

- Each panel shall be represented by a state object containing:
  - A list of tabs.
  - The ID of the currently active tab.
- Each tab shall have:
  - A unique identifier (ID).
  - A title (string).
  - An ordered list of zones.
- Each zone shall have:
  - A unique identifier (ID).
  - An ordered list of components.
- Each component shall have:
  - A unique identifier (ID).
  - A type (string, e.g. `"chart"`, `"table"`, `"form"`).
  - Props (object) to configure its behavior and display.

### 4. Action Protocol

The system shall support a set of discrete actions for UI state changes, including but not limited to:

#### Tab Actions

- `addTab`: Add a new tab.
- `removeTab`: Remove an existing tab.
- `renameTab`: Change the title of a tab.
- `reorderTabs`: Change the order of tabs.
- `switchTab`: Set the active (focused) tab.

#### Zone Actions

- `addZone`: Add a new zone to a tab.
- `removeZone`: Remove a zone from a tab.
- `reorderZones`: Change the order of zones within a tab.

#### Component Actions

- `addComponent`: Add a new component to a zone.
- `removeComponent`: Remove a component from a zone.
- `updateComponent`: Change the type or properties of a component.
- `reorderComponents`: Change the order of components within a zone.

#### Bulk/Advanced Actions

- `setPanelState`: Replace the entire panel state.

All actions must be defined as messages (such as JSON objects) with explicit fields for target IDs and payloads.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- All updates to the panel must be reflected in real-time in the UI.
- The system should ensure state consistency and atomicity for bulk updates.
- Tab, zone, and component IDs must be unique within their respective scopes.
- The system must be extensible to support additional component types in the future.
- The data model and action protocol should be designed to support both local and remote (AI-driven) control.
- The system shall support undo and redo functionality for AI-driven changes.

---

## Example Action Messages

```json
// Switch active tab
{ "action": "switchTab", "tabId": "tab2" }

// Add a new component to a zone
{
  "action": "addComponent",
  "tabId": "tab2",
  "zoneId": "zoneA",
  "component": {
    "id": "comp5",
    "type": "chart",
    "props": { "data": [1,2,3] }
  }
}
```

---

## Out of Scope

- Deeply nested zones (zones within zones).
- Component types not already supported by the base system.
- UI styling and theming (focus is on structure and state/protocol).
- Hiding/showing tabs or zones without removal.
- Collaborative (multi-user) control of the panel.

---

## Open Questions & Answers

- Should the AI be able to hide/show entire tabs or zones without removal?  
  **A:** No, removal only for now.
- Do we need undo/redo mechanisms for AI-driven changes?  
  **A:** Yes, include undo/redo functionality.
- Is there a need for collaborative (multi-user) control of the panel?  
  **A:** No.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- The side panel with tabbed zones must be present and function as specified.
- All AI-driven actions described above must be supported and reflected in the UI.
- Undo/redo for AI-driven changes must be implemented.
- The data model and action protocol must be well-documented and extensible.
